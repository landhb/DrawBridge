A layer 4 Single Packet Authentication (SPA) Module, used to conceal TCP/UDP ports on public facing machines and add an extra layer of security. 

Note: DrawBridge now supports both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic

Please read the corresponding [article](https://www.landhb.me/posts/bODdK/port-knocking-with-netfilter-kernel-modules/) for a more in-depth look at the design. 

## Easy Setup and Configuration

To automagically generate keys run the following on your client machine:

```bash
./gen_keys.sh
```

The output of the gen_keys.sh script will be two files: `private.pem` and `key.h`. Keep `private.pem` on your client machine and put a copy of `key.h` on the server with the kernel source before you build it. 


To compile either the client application or the kernel module simply cd into the respective directories and run `make`. 

```bash
# on the client machine
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
cd client
make

# on the server compile the module and load it
# pass the ports you want to monitor as an argument

cd kernel
make
sudo modprobe x_tables
sudo insmod drawbridge.ko ports=22,445 
```

You may need to install your kernel headers to compile the module, you can do so with:

```
sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
```

This code has been tested on Linux Kernel 4.4, 4.10, and 4.13. I don't plan to support anything earlier than 4.X but let me know if you encounter some portabilitity issues on newer kernels. 

## Customizing a Unique 'knock' Packet

If you wish to customize your knock a little more you can edit the TCP header options in client/bridge.c. For instance, maybe you want to make your knock packet have the PSH,RST,and ACK flags set and a window size of 3104. Turn those on:

```c
// Flags
(*pkt)->tcp_h.fin = 0;   // 1
(*pkt)->tcp_h.syn = 0;   // 2
(*pkt)->tcp_h.rst = 1;   // 4
(*pkt)->tcp_h.psh = 1;   // 8
(*pkt)->tcp_h.ack = 1;   // 16
(*pkt)->tcp_h.urg = 0;   // 32


(*pkt)->tcp_h.window = htons(3104);
```

Then make sure you can create a BPF filter to match that specific packet. For the above we would have RST(4) + PSH(8) + ACK(16) = 28 and the offset for the window field in the TCP header is 14:

```
"tcp[tcpflags] == 28 and tcp[14:2] = 3104"
```

[Here is a good short article on tcp flags if you're unfamiliar.](https://danielmiessler.com/study/tcpflags/). Because tcpdump doesn't support tcp offset shortcuts for IPv6 you have to work with offsets relative to the IPv6 header to support it:

```
(tcp[tcpflags] == 28 and tcp[14:2] = 3104) or (ip6[40+13] == 28 and ip6[(40+14):2] = 3104)"
```

After you have a working BPF filter, you need to compile it and include the filter in the kernel module server-side. So to compile this and place the output in kernel/listen.c in struct sock_filter code[]:

```
tcpdump "(tcp[tcpflags] == 28 and tcp[14:2] = 3104) or (ip6[40+13] == 28 and ip6[(40+14):2] = 3104)" -dd
```

which gives us:

```c
struct sock_filter code[] = {
	{ 0x28, 0, 0, 0x0000000c },
	{ 0x15, 0, 9, 0x00000800 },
	{ 0x30, 0, 0, 0x00000017 },
	{ 0x15, 0, 13, 0x00000006 },
	{ 0x28, 0, 0, 0x00000014 },
	{ 0x45, 11, 0, 0x00001fff },
	{ 0xb1, 0, 0, 0x0000000e },
	{ 0x50, 0, 0, 0x0000001b },
	{ 0x15, 0, 8, 0x0000001c },
	{ 0x48, 0, 0, 0x0000001c },
	{ 0x15, 5, 6, 0x00000c20 },
	{ 0x15, 0, 5, 0x000086dd },
	{ 0x30, 0, 0, 0x00000043 },
	{ 0x15, 0, 3, 0x0000001c },
	{ 0x28, 0, 0, 0x00000044 },
	{ 0x15, 0, 1, 0x00000c20 },
	{ 0x6, 0, 0, 0x00040000 },
	{ 0x6, 0, 0, 0x00000000 },
};
```

And there you go! You have a unique packet that the DrawBridge kernel module will parse!


## Generating an RSA Key Pair Manually

First generate the key pair:

```
openssl genrsa -des3 -out private.pem 2048
```

Export the public key to a seperate file:

```bash
openssl rsa -in private.pem -outform DER -pubout -out public.der
```

If you take a look at the format, you'll see that this doesn't exactly match the kernel struct representation of a public key, so we'll need to extract the relevant data from the BIT_STRING field in the DER format:

```bash
vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:~$ openssl asn1parse  -in public.der -inform DER

0:d=0  hl=4 l= 290 cons: SEQUENCE
4:d=1  hl=2 l=  13 cons: SEQUENCE
6:d=2  hl=2 l=   9 prim: OBJECT            :rsaEncryption
17:d=2  hl=2 l=   0 prim: NULL
19:d=1  hl=4 l= 271 prim: BIT STRING        <-------------------- THIS IS WHAT WE NEED
```

You can see that the BIT_STRING is at offset 19. From here we can extract the relevant portion of the private key format to provide the kernel module:

```bash
openssl asn1parse  -in public.der -inform DER -strparse 19 -out output.der
```

You'll notice that this is compatible with [RFC 3447 where it outlines ASN.1 syntax for an RSA public key](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3447#page-44).

```bash
0:d=0  hl=4 l= 266 cons: SEQUENCE
4:d=1  hl=4 l= 257 prim: INTEGER           :BB82865B85ED420CF36054....
265:d=1  hl=2 l=   3 prim: INTEGER           :010001
```

If you need to dump output.der as a C-style byte string:

```bash
hexdump -v -e '16/1 "_x%02X" "\n"' output.der | sed 's/_/\\/g; s/\\x  //g; s/.*/    "&"/'
```
